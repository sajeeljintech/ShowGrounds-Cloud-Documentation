# Ingate & Announcer Users

In the past, ingate and announcer users did not need login credentials to access the announcer tool. Moving to the cloud, these users will now need to have an SGL account to access the tool.&#x20;



Users will need to register for an SGL account if they do not already have one. The following link walks through how to register for an SGL account.

Once the ingates/announcers have their SGL accounts registered and confirmed, and the show company has the user added to their ingate group, the user can log in to access the Announcer tool.&#x20;
