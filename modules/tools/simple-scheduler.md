# üóìÔ∏è Simple Scheduler

The simple scheduler is a tool that allows the horse show to share estimated class times on the web based on numbers of horses in classes and other customizable settings. These times will update in real time on the web as horses are added or dropped. Once the horse show begins, actual times are made available immediately to exhibitors on the web as the announcer, in-gate person or manager ticks off rounds as they go in the announcer interface (on the wheel in the class window under the in-gate and announcer tab).



The Simple Scheduler is found in the Tools section of the menu on the left side when you are logged in the program.&#x20;

Opening the Simple Scheduler tool will show the following screen:

If it is a multi ring, multi day horse show, select the ring and day you wish to schedule.&#x20;

A new user preference has been added to the Simple Scheduler tool. When viewing the day‚Äôs class groups, a user may choose to check the Auto Scroll box, which will automatically build and expand the class group window as seen below:

Alternatively, a user may chose to uncheck the auto scroll box which builds a scrollbar in the class groups box which will remain the same size as classes are added.

In the Add/Edit Group section, you will begin by selecting the planned start-up time for the ring. Begin adding classes in the order they appear on the time schedule.

Simply type in the class number and how many minutes per trip you estimate each course will take to complete if it is a jumping class. If a flat or Under Saddle class, click the ‚Äútrips go all at once‚Äù and estimate the amount of time the class will take to complete. If it is a group of the same classes (multiple jumping classes being run concurrently), put all of the class numbers together in the classes box, separated by commas. The name of the class will auto fill but can be changed to suit your needs.

If you need ‚Äúpadding‚Äù of times, you can put some time into the ‚Äúclass set up time‚Äù box. Once it is ready to insert, click the ADD button. This will put the classes into the schedule above. When complete, the window will look something like this:

### Adding Breaks

Adding breaks to a schedule is done by selecting the Info Class button.&#x20;

Once the user has selected the ‚ÄúInfo Class‚Äù button, they need to input the following information:

The name of the break they are adding.

The planned start time of the break.

The break duration (this time is in minutes). <mark style="color:red;">\*It is important to remember to input your break duration, especially in a live schedule.\*</mark>

Once the info is entered, select the add button and the break will be input into the schedule and will show highlighted in yellow.

### Online Schedule

Once you have your schedule saved, the following is an example of how that will look online.&#x20;

This acts exactly the same as the previous online schedule.&#x20;



### Setting Default Trip Times

By default, the trip time for an over fences trip will be 3 minutes, and a flat class will be 15 minutes.

If you want to change the default times for over fences and flat classes, you will choose the Administration option at the bottom of the menu.

This will bring you to the administrative side of Showgrounds and prompt you to login.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (65).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When you have logged in, you will want to choose the Preferences option under Settings.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (66).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This will open both My Preferences and System Preferences. To get to the default times, you will choose the Additional option from the System Preferences tab.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (67).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The default time settings are found under the label Default Class Signup Settings. You can change the minutes per trip in this section. Once you have these set to your desired time, hit the save button at the bottom of the page.&#x20;
