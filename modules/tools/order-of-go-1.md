# ðŸ“‹ Order of Go

The Order of Go tool is found in the Tools section of the menu.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (127).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When you open the Order of Go tool, the first thing you want to make sure is you are in the correct show. Up at the top of the page is the show dropbox. If you need to be in a different show, you will just select the show in this box.&#x20;

### Order Type and Set Order By

1. Order Type is the determination of if there is no order, a set order, or if the order will be set by individual exhibitors on the web.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (129).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. Set Order By determines who on the entry the order will be set by. Choosing rider or trainer will differentiate between those two options. If you choose manually, that will allow a person to manually set the order. \
   \
   Each of these options will change how Steps 2 and 3 work.&#x20;

### Step 2:

However the user chooses to set the order by, step 2 can be expanded or collapsed when the user is setting the order.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (32).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is done by clicking the Step 2 Heading bar.

## Set Order By: Trainer

### Step 1: Select Class Group

In this section of the order of go, you will select the Show Date, the Ring, and the Event for which you are setting the order.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (131).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have selected the specific class you are wanting to work with, your entry list will show in the next steps.&#x20;





### Step 2: Trainers With Multiple Trips

Step 2 will show all of the trainers in the chosen class who have multiple trips.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (132).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For this example, there are 5 trainers who have multiple trips in this class.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (133).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

These trainers' entries will show color coded in the list of entries in the final step.&#x20;



### Step 3: Set Order

This is the section to complete the set order for the class.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-01-14 at 1.20.37 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Trips can be ordered by clicking and dragging the desired entry to the correct order place.&#x20;

Trips that are highlighted are the trips of trainers' with multiple trips in the class.

Previously, users had to scroll through the order to see all of the ordered trips. Now, this information shows fully without scrolling through the ordered section.&#x20;

As you are working on the order, you will have a message in red just as a reminder to save when you have completed everything.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (136).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have your order set, you can choose to publish it to the web. Leaving the box unchecked will not publish the order.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (137).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you need to clear the changes you have made, you can select the Clear Order button.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (139).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have everything set, you will choose Save Order and your changes will be saved for that class.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (138).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



## Set Order By: Rider

### Step 1: Select Class Group

In this section of the order of go, you will select the Show Date, the Ring, and the Event for which you are setting the order.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (131).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have selected the specific class you are wanting to work with, your entry list will show in the next steps.&#x20;



### Step 2: Select Point Horse For Riders With Multiple Horses

Step 2 shows all riders that have multiple trips on multiple horses in the class. For this example, there are 2 riders in this class who have multiple horses entered.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (140).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Each rider has a dropbox with their horses. Whichever horse is chosen for each rider will be that rider's first trip. So for this example, Eva Mackenzie will ride Super Micke first and ride her other horse for her second trip.&#x20;



### Step 3: Set Order

This step works the same as when the order is set by trainer. The difference here is that instead of the trainers with multiple trips being highlighted, the riders with multiple trips are highlighted instead.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (141).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



## Set Order By: Manually

### Step 1: Select Class Group

In this section of the order of go, you will select the Show Date, the Ring, and the Event for which you are setting the order.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (131).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have selected the specific class you are wanting to work with, your entry list will show in the next steps.&#x20;



### List of Unordered Trips

In this step, all of the unordered trips will show in this section. As you add entries to the ordered list, this list will grow shorter until you have the entire class ordered.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (78).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



### Step 3: Set Order

This step works the same as the other ways. You can click an entry and drag it to the place you want it to be. Once you have your order set, hit the Save Order button and the order is set.&#x20;



&#x20;When using the Order of Go tool, users can use the enter key in the Provide Entry No. to Set Order box. Once the enter key is hit or the order trip button is selected for the particular entry, the entry will show in the Ordered section and the entry box will clear for you to continue with other entries.&#x20;

### Set Order Updates

As shown below, once the Order of Go is set or updated, the date and time of the change along with the user who made the change will appear in red.

The following link will show how this process works.&#x20;
