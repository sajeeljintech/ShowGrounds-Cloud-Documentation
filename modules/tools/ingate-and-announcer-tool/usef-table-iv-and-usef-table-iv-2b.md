# USEF Table IV and USEF Table IV 2b

Ingate users need to set the Optimum Time for Round 1 and jump off round based on the specific table that is being used.

When using table IV, the Optimum Time must be set for Round 1.

When using table IV 2b, the Optimum Time must be set for Round 1 and the Jump Off.

The Optimum Time is set by default to be 4 seconds less than the time allowed, but users can override this value.&#x20;
