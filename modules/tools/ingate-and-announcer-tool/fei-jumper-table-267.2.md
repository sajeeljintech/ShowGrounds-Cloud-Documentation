# FEI Jumper Table 267.2

Users can set the number of R2 callbacks in the Jumper Settings section. The amount of trips that will come back for the 2nd round will show in green in the list.&#x20;

Trips under this jumper rule that compete in the second round will go in order from worst to best. We have added a checkbox, Order R2 for Callback Trips, that will allow the user to see the trips ordered from worst to best on their performance in the first round.
