When using this jumper table, the user needs to set the Time Allowed for the third round and the number of R2 callbacks. When choosing this jumper table, if the user does not set the number of R2 callbacks, it will automatically be set to 16. However, the user can set this to a different number of callbacks if needed.&#x20;

When using this table, it is assumed that half of the 16 round 2 trips will compete in round 3. These trips are shown highlighted in yellow.

Using the Order R2 for Callback trips checkbox will order the 16 trips in order from worst to best in ranking since the additional rounds for these classes have the competitors jump in order of their ranking from worst to last.&#x20;
