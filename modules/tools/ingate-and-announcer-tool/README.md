# ðŸ“¢ Ingate & Announcer Tool



## Important Changes

In the old ShowGrounds system, users who acted as an ingate or announcer did not have to use login credentials to access the tool. Moving to the cloud, all ingate and announcers will need to have a SGL login and be added to their show company's ingate and announcer group.&#x20;



## Accessing the Tool

Users must now log in to the cloud site to access the ingate and announcer tool. This is done by going to the cloud site: [https://app.showgroundslive.com/auth](https://app.showgroundslive.com/auth).

The user will then use their SGL login credentials to log into the cloud system.&#x20;

Opening the Announcer Tool in the Cloud system will automatically bring the user to the Ingate & Announcer section of the tool. This is the most used portion of this tool, but there are two other working sections in this tool as well.&#x20;

### Ingate & Announcer

This is the section that ingates and announcers will mainly work out of and is automatically opened when users access the Announcer Tool.&#x20;



At the top of this page, you will choose the specific date, ring, and class you are working with.&#x20;

&#x20;

On the left side of the page, you will see the trips that are remaining for the specific class.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (57).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this particular example, it shows a scratched entry. This is for a class that has already run. If you want to hide scratched entries, you can do this by checking the Hide Scratched button.&#x20;

Ingate/announcer scratch actions will now be logged in an entry and will be available in the office (Client)  when viewing history for entry.

The remaining trips can be sorted by horse, rider, etc.&#x20;

A horse/rider status column has now been added to this view.

The middle column shows the trips that have gone.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (61).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This section shows each entry's position(placing), the order they went in, their entry number, the timing and faults in the round, the jump-off timing and faults, the rider, the horse, and if their trip has gone.&#x20;

Entries in green indicate that the entry qualified for the jump-off round.&#x20;

Entries highlighted in red indicate elimination in the class.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (62).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The final column is where the timing and faults are actually input for each trip.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (52).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To access each trip to add faults and times is done so by clicking the trip in the middle column. The trip details will update to show the specific entry and changes can be done for that trip.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (143).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You will notice that there are two sections for Scoring Faults/Time. The first section is to record the faults and times for the first round. The second section is to record the faults and times for the jump-off round.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (144).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In each of these sections, you can input the trip faults, if there are time faults, the time for the trip, a description, and a disqualify status.&#x20;

The following are the different options for disqualifications.&#x20;

Once you have your information entered, you will hit the store button to save the information for each round.&#x20;

### Order of Go

This tab controls the order of go for classes. If the order has not already been set for a class, it can be set in this section.&#x20;

The top of this section controls what class you are ordering. Users will select the specific class by the date, ring, and then the class number. Once you have chosen your class, it will show all of the entries.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (146).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Since this class has already run, the entries all show in the Ordered Trips column. If this was a class that the order had not been set, the trips would show in the left column.

Setting the order of go here is done by clicking the button at the bottom of the page.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (147).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This will take you to the order of go tool. You can set your order here.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (148).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



### Score Board

This tab controls each rings' scoreboard messages. You will select the appropriate ring and can type out your message. Once you have it set, you will hit send and the message will show on that scoreboard.
