# Inviting Your Users to Create SGL Accounts

Users in the system will be limited to what they can do in the system based on the groups they are in. Show administrators have to set their groups to include the users who will be accessing those areas.

To add users to the different groups, you will first log into the admin site.&#x20;

Once you are logged in, you will want to choose the Groups tab from the menu on the left side of the page.&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (93).png>)

This section will show all of the groups associated to your specific show company.&#x20;

Opening a group, will show you the members in that group. If there are no members, it will show No Members Found.

To add members to your group, you will choose the Add/Invite User option.&#x20;

A popup will appear for you to search SGL account holders for the person you are wanting to add to the group.&#x20;

If the person you search for has an SGL account, they will show up for you to add.&#x20;

If the person you are trying to add to the group doesn't have an SGL account, there will be the option to invite that person to register for an SGL account.&#x20;

When you choose invite, it will prompt you to enter the email for the person you are inviting to register for an SGL account.&#x20;
