# Sponsor Management

## Overview

Sponsors are now managed through the adminstrative section of SGL. Show company administrators can manage these sponsors.&#x20;

Administrators can access this tool by logging into the admin site for their company. The Sponsors option is found in the menu under Settings.

### Viewing Your Sponsors

Accessing the Sponsors page will show the current list view of the company's sponsors.

To add a new sponsor to the list, users will need to use the add button in the top right corner. This will bring up the page to input the sponsor information.

The information needed for a sponsor includes the name of the sponsor, an email address, site url, and a logo.&#x20;

Once the user has input the sponsor information, choosing save will add the new sponsor to the available list.&#x20;



### Choosing the Show Sponsor

Once the sponsor is created, users can select the show sponsor.&#x20;

To do this, users must go into the specific show record. On the general tab of the show, there is now a section to choose the show sponsor. This is found in the bottom right corner.&#x20;

Users can select the specific sponsor from the dropbox.&#x20;

Once the user has the desired sponsor selected, the logo for that sponsor will show in that section.&#x20;

The user must then save the show record to save the show sponsor.&#x20;
