If the user has an existing SGL account, the search should populate that person's account.&#x20;

You can choose the correct individual and then choose Add and that person will be added to the group.&#x20;



If the person you are trying to add to the group doesn't have an SGL account, your search will show that there were no records found and the option to invite a user will appear in the box.&#x20;

When you choose invite, you will have to re-enter the person's email to invite them to register for an SGL account. This will send an email to that person to invite them to register for an SGL account. Once they have completed registration, that person will be a member of the particular group.&#x20;
