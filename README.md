# Linking 4D and SGL Login

All users will be required to have an ShowGroundsLive.com login in order to continue logging into the 4D system.  This linking process also establishes your login for the cloud platform once that is launched

## Linking

When logging into the 4D system users will be presented with the option to link your existing login to a ShowGroundsLive.com login. &#x20;

### Step 1 - Creating a ShowGroundsLive.com login

{% hint style="warning" %}
IMPORANT - If you already have an SGL login, proceed to [#step-2-link-your-sgl-login-during-login-process](./#step-2-link-your-sgl-login-during-login-process "mention")
{% endhint %}

If you do not have an SGL login you MUST register for an SGL login before you can continue this process

To Register follow this link [https://showgroundslive.com/registration/](https://showgroundslive.com/registration/)

Fill in the form\

{% hint style="danger" %}
IMPORTANT - You must be able to receive email and click confirmation link BEFORE your SGL login will be active.
{% endhint %}

If you are unsure how to register for an account, you can click the following link. This will give a walk through on how to complete your registration.

### Step 2 - Link your SGL login during login process

Once login linking has been enabled for your show company, you will be prompted at login to link your SGL login. You will only have to complete the linking process once.&#x20;

Once we begin the linking process, when you enter your login credentials into the software to log in, instead of the login button, it will say next.&#x20;

Choosing that Next option will bring a popup to enter your SGL login credentials.&#x20;

Once you have entered your email and password for your SGL account, choose the Link and Login button. A note will appear informing you that an email confirmation link has been sent.&#x20;

You will need to proceed with the linking process through that email. If you try to log in through the software without going through the email link, you will receive an error message.&#x20;
